# Data-Mining (2022 Fall Semester)

### There are three assignments for the Data Mining course in this semester.

* **HW1:** &nbsp;*Apriori-algorithm / FP-growth algorithm* <br>
Implement **Apriori-algorithm** and **FP-growth algorithm**, and use IBM Quest Synthetic Data Generator <br>
to generate some datasets to analyze how the support and confidence levels affect the association of <br>
data selected from the dataset. Also, test and analyze datasets downloaded from Kaggle.

* **HW2:** &nbsp;*Analyze self-generated data with machine learning models.* <br>
Analyze the **self-generated data** and **set rules** to classify the data using machine learning models. <br>
Then observe and analyze whether different classifiers can correctly identify the rules for classifying <br> 
the data, and whether there are different results when the data contains noise.

* **HW3:** &nbsp; *Implement HIS, PageRank, SimRank* <br>
Implement **HITS**, **PageRank**, and **SimRank algorithms**, and calculate the **authority**, **hubs**, **Pagerank**, <br>
and **Simrank values** of each vertex in the graph to find out the important vertices and discover <br>
the characteristics of each algorithm.
